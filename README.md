# The JWLI Mockup

This is a mockup for the Japan Women's Leadership Initiative. It is a clean, simple design that is responsive, and holds information/background about the initiative.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

To practice using floats in CSS, I used floats to create the overall layout of the website and each section. This is a pretty simple design that can be used as a template for many other websites, so it actually was not too hard to construct. The CSS part of it ws not too difficult either, as again, it is very simple. 

## Lessons Learned:

I can now take this layout as a template for other projects, and can continue tweaking it to fix some minor details. I learned more about making websites responsive in this project as well, so I can take this experience and apply it to new projects as well.
